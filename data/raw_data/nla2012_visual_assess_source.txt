HI, Bryan,

I saw a file on the NLA SharePoint site named wide_assessment.tab that was dated July 30, 2014.  It may not be posted on the public website because it is not directly used for the report. 

Here is the version I found on our version of NARS IM (it has a later publication date).  The .met is the “metadata” file.  Both are tab-delimited text files.  I cannot say how much QA was done on these (especially for the things you listed below), so you make want to make sure they pass your laugh test in some fashion.

We finally got some sunshine and warm weather for a few days!  Plus I get to see the total solar eclipse from my office window come August21!

Dave
